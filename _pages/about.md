Hello, welcome to my personal website!

My name is Prachii and I absolutely adore space technology and its applications. In general, I love engineering in all its forms, and am a software engineer by day and an electronics engineer by night. I enjoy creating pipelines that require on board spacecraft computing, as well as ground-based imagery analysis (investigating geospatial data with QGIS, gdal, rasterio). I want to advance space technology through generative AI, edge computing, and intelligent on-board processing systems. I recently worked with Vitis AI to learn to how to use DPUs on Xilinx's FPGA for hardware acceleration!!

On the electronics front end: I am well familiar with embedded Linux and used a 
minimal Linux distribution (buildroot) to create the root file systems 
for IP cameras. My work focused on integrating the image 
signal processors to build in-house IP cameras.  
I’ve dabbled in microcontrollers to monitor basic functionality in multi-component 
systems. (Intel NUC, IP cameras, battery source etc).


On the hobby front end: Currently I am developing and documenting the creation of Boromi, a small robot built on Raspberry Pi's model 4B that I made for a dear friend. Boromi's a very simple robot that behaves as a radio station and therapist. I am still deciding between MobileNet and EdgeNext for its face recognition and it would seem that the latter outperforms the former. Let's see!!

I am also a curious person and adore my two dogs Hebi and Roxy.
