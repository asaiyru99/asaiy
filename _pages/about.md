My name is Prachii and I absolutely adore space technology and its applications. In general, I love engineering in all its forms, and am a software engineer by day and an electronics engineer by night. I have expertise in satellite image processing, machine learning, and embedded AI systems. I’m able to quantize and deploy models on a satellite OBCs, leveraging strong foundations in electronics engineering. I’m also very passionate about advancing space technology through generative AI, edge computing, and intelligent on-board processing systems. I recently worked with Vitis AI to learn to how to use DPUs on Xilinx's FPGA for hardware acceleration!!

On the electronics front end: I am well familiar with embedded Linux and used a 
minimal Linux distribution (buildroot) to create the root file systems 
for IP cameras. My work focused on integrating the image 
signal processors to build in-house IP cameras.  
I’ve dabbled in microcontrollers to monitor basic functionality in multi-component 
systems. (Intel NUC, IP cameras, battery source etc).


On the hobby front end: Currently I am developing and documenting the creation of Boromi, a small robot built on Raspberry Pi's model 4B that I made for a dear friend. Boromi's a very simple robot that behaves as a radio station and therapist. I am still deciding between MobileNet and EdgeNext for its face recognition and it would seem that the latter outperforms the former. Let's see!!


Edge AI is on the rise for the intelligent inference of an AI model, but we still have a way to go for generative AI. 
I am also a curious person and adore my two dogs Hebi and Roxy.
